# Express.js Route Handler Bug: Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, attempting to parse a user ID without sufficient validation. This can lead to unexpected crashes or errors if the ID is not a number.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling to prevent these issues.  The solution includes explicit checks to ensure the ID is a valid integer before attempting to parse it, preventing potential errors and improving the overall robustness of the application.
